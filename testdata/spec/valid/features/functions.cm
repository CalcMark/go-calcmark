# Function Call Syntax Test

All valid function call syntaxes in CalcMark.

## Traditional Function Syntax

avg(10, 20, 30)
avg(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
sqrt(16)
sqrt(2)

## Natural Language Function Syntax

average of 10, 20, 30
average of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
square root of 16
square root of 2

## Functions with Expressions

avg(x, y, z)
avg(10 + 5, 20 * 2, 30 - 10)
sqrt(x + y)
square root of (a + b)

## Nested Functions

avg(sqrt(16), sqrt(25))
sqrt(avg(1, 2, 3))
average of square root of 4, square root of 9

## Functions in Assignments

mean = avg(10, 20, 30)
root = sqrt(16)
calculated = average of 100, 200, 300
side = square root of 25

## Mixed Syntax in Same Document

Traditional syntax:
total1 = avg(1, 2, 3)

Natural language syntax:
total2 = average of 1, 2, 3

Both should produce same result:
same = total1 == total2
