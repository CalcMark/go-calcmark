# Rate-based capacity planning
# "How many servers to handle 10000 req/s if each handles 450 req/s?"
10000 req/s at 450 req/s per server

# Bandwidth capacity
100 MB/s at 10 MB/s per connection

# Items in containers
100 apples at 30 per crate

# Pure numbers (abstract units)
100 at 25 per batch

# With buffer percentages
10 TB at 2 TB per disk with 10% buffer
10000 req/s at 450 req/s per server with 20% buffer
100 at 30 per crate with 50% buffer

# Edge cases

100 at 100 per unit

# Alternative slash syntax (instead of "per")
