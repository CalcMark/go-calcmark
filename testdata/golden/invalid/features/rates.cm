# Invalid Rate Expressions
# These are PARSE ERRORS - syntactically invalid
# (Semantic validity is separate - arbitrary units like "apples" are semantically fine)

# Invalid time units (not in isTimeUnit list - PARSE ERROR)
100 MB/nanosecond
100 MB per fortnight
100 MB/century
50 apples/millisecond

# These would be parse errors due to incomplete syntax
# Uncommented because they'd fail the file parse:
# 100 MB per      # Missing time unit
# /second         # Missing amount  
# per day         # Missing amount
