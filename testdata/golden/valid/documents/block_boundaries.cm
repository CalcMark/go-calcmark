# Block Boundary Rules Test

This tests the **two empty line rule** for creating hard block boundaries.

## Same Type, One Empty Line

x = 10

y = 20

These two calculations should be in the SAME CalcBlock.

## Same Type, Two Empty Lines

a = 1


b = 2

These should be in DIFFERENT CalcBlocks (two empty lines = hard boundary).

## Different Types Always Split

c = 3

This is text.

d = 4

Even with one empty line, different types create boundaries.

## Text Blocks with Two Empty Lines

First text paragraph.


Second text paragraph.

These should be separate TextBlocks.

## Text Blocks with One Empty Line

First paragraph.

Second paragraph.

These should be in the SAME TextBlock.
