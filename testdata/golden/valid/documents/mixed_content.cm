# Mixed Content Test

This document tests the **core CalcMark feature**: mixing markdown text with calculations.

## Text Block

This is plain markdown text. It should be detected as a TextBlock.

## Calculation Block

price = 100
tax = price * 0.08
total = price + tax

## Another Text Block

Now we're back to text. This should be a separate TextBlock.

The empty line above keeps this paragraph in the same block.

## More Calculations

x = 10
y = 20
sum = x + y

## Edge Case: Single Empty Line

This text block is separated by only ONE empty line from the calculations above.
It should still be a separate block (type changes always create boundaries).

## Edge Case: Two Empty Lines


This text is separated by TWO empty lines from above.
It's definitely a new block.

## Final Calculations

result = sum * 2
