# Rate Unit Conversion
# Tests converting rates between different quantity and time units.

# Length rate conversions (same time unit)
speed1 = 10 m/s in inch/s
speed2 = 100 km/h in mile/h
speed3 = 60 feet/s in m/s

# Time unit conversion only (same quantity unit)
rate1 = 60 m/s in m/min

# Combined quantity and time conversion
speed4 = 1 km/h in m/s
speed5 = 100 km/h in m/s

# Using 'per' syntax for target
speed6 = 10 m/s in inch per second
speed7 = 60 km/h in mile per hour

# Mass rate conversion
mass_rate1 = 10 kg/s in lb/s
mass_rate2 = 100 lb/h in kg/h

# Length-to-length with time change
speed8 = 1 mile/h in feet/s

# Time-only conversion with simple time unit target
# "10 MB/day in seconds" keeps MB, converts day to seconds
data_rate1 = 10 MB/day in seconds
data_rate2 = 100 GB/month in hours
