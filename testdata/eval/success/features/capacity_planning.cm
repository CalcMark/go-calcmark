# Valid Capacity Planning Examples
# Natural syntax for capacity() function using "at ... per" syntax

# Basic capacity planning: demand at capacity per unit
10000 req/s at 450 req/s per server
10 TB at 2 TB per disk
100 at 30 per crate

# With buffer percentage
10000 req/s at 450 req/s per server with 20% buffer
10 TB at 2 TB per disk with 10% buffer
1000 at 100 per batch with 50% buffer

# Various buffer percentages
100 at 25 per unit with 0.1% buffer
1000 at 200 per container with 120% buffer
5000 at 500 per box with 1000% buffer

# Edge cases
5 at 10 per unit        # demand < capacity, still needs 1 unit
100 at 100 per item     # exact match, needs 1 unit
