# Valid Capacity Planning Examples
# Natural syntax for requires() function

# Basic capacity planning: load with capacity
10000 req/s with 450 req/s
10 TB with 2 TB  
100 with 30

# With buffer percentage
10000 req/s with 450 req/s and 20%
10 TB with 2 TB and 10%
1000 with 100 and 50%

# Various buffer percentages
100 with 25 and 0.1%
1000 with 200 and 120%
5000 with 500 and 1k%

# Edge cases
5 with 10        # load < capacity, still needs 1 unit
100 with 100     # exact match, needs 1 unit
