# Incompatible Unit Operations

These expressions demonstrate runtime errors when operating on incompatible units.

## Mismatched arbitrary units

When adding or subtracting quantities with different arbitrary units, the interpreter produces an error because it cannot convert between unrelated units.

5 apples + 3 oranges
10 widgets + 5 items
100 cats - 50 dogs

## Plural vs singular

The system cannot automatically recognize that "goose" and "geese" refer to the same thing. These are treated as different units.

1 goose + 2 geese
5 cat + 3 cats
10 person + 5 people
2 mouse + 3 mice

## Known units with different dimensions

Even with known units, mixing dimensions (length + mass, volume - mass) is not allowed.

10 meters + 5 kg
100 liters - 50 pounds
5 feet * 3 meters

## Quantity times Quantity

Multiplying two quantities together is not currently supported.

5 meters * 3 meters
10 kg * 2 kg
