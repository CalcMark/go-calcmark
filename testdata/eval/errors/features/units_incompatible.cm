# Incompatible Unit Operations

These expressions parse correctly but fail at evaluation because units cannot be combined or converted.

## Mixing Dimensions

Length, mass, and volume are fundamentally different dimensions.

10 meters + 5 kilograms
100 grams + 2 liters
5 feet + 3 cups

## Converting Arbitrary Units

Arbitrary units like "apples" cannot be converted to known measurement units.

10 apples in meters
5 widgets in kilograms
100 items in liters

## Arbitrary with Known Units

Arbitrary units cannot be combined with known measurement units.

10 apples + 5 meters
5 widgets + 3 kilograms

## Different Arbitrary Units

Different arbitrary units cannot be added together since there's no defined conversion.

10 apples + 5 bananas
100 widgets + 50 gadgets
