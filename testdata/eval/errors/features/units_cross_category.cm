# Cross-Category Unit Operations

These expressions are syntactically valid CalcMark but produce runtime errors because they attempt to combine units from incompatible categories.

## Temperature with other units

Temperature cannot be combined with length or mass dimensions.

10 celsius + 5 meters
100 fahrenheit + 10 kilograms

## Speed with Length

Speed and length are fundamentally different dimensions.

50 mph + 10 meters
100 kph + 5 kilometers

## Energy with Power

Energy (joules, kWh) measures total work done. Power (watts) measures rate of energy transfer. They cannot be directly added.

1000 joules + 100 watts
1 kwh + 1 kilowatt

## Power with other dimensions

Power cannot be combined with length or mass.

1 horsepower + 10 meters
5 watts + 5 kilograms

## Energy with Mass

Energy and mass are different physical quantities.

100 calories + 5 grams
1 kj + 1 kilogram

## Temperature with Energy

Temperature and energy measure different properties.

100 celsius + 1000 joules
50 fahrenheit + 1 kwh
